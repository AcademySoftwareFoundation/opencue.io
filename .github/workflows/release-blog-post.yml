name: OpenCue Release Blog Post

# Workflow to automate the creation of a blog post for an OpenCue release.
#
# This workflow is triggered externally via the `workflow_dispatch` event sent via the
# GitHub REST API.
#
# It can be triggered manually by sending an HTTP request:
#   $ curl \
#       -X POST
#       -u "${{ secrets.PAT_USERNAME}}:${{secrets.PAT_TOKEN}}" \
#       -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
#       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
#       https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/opencue.io/actions/workflows/2618928/dispatches \
#       --data '{"ref": "master", "inputs": {"release_version": "vX.X.X"}}'
#
# The main OpenCue release pipeline uses this to trigger a new blog post when
# the release is created on the main code repository.
