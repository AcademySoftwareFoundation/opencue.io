  A guide to setting up an end-to-end development environment on Windows.
---

This is a guide to setting up a development environment on Windows that will allow 
you to run the entire OpenCue system from end-to-end (Cuebot, Cuesubmit, CueGUI, RQD)
and make changes to any part of it.

## Prerequisites

First, clone the [OpenCue git repository](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue)
to your machine. You will then need to download & install three core dependencies:

- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
- [Java SE JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

It is also useful to have IDEs installed. JetBrains has free versions of both:

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

## Database setup

After installing Postgres you will need to create a database and user for OpenCue
(specifically CueBot) to use.

To do this you can either use the pgAdmin GUI (included with Postgres on Windows),
or the commandline Postgres client.

### Using the commandline

Download the `schema-*.sql` and `demo-*.sql` files from the [the releases page](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/releases).

Open Powershell, then run `psql`:

```powershell
# Change the following path depending on what version of Postgres you have:
$psql = 'C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\bin\psql.exe'
& $psql -U postgres
```

You will need to enter the password you set during Postgres installation.
Next, enter the following `psql` commands to set up the user and database:

```psql
create user opencue with password 'INSERT PASSWORD HERE';
create database opencue;
\connect opencue
alter default privileges in schema public grant all privileges on tables to opencue;
\include schema-*.sql # actual filename will change depending on version
set search_path = public;
\include demo_data-*.sql # actual filename will change depending on version
\quit
```

### Using the pgAdmin GUI

1. **Start pgAdmin**: Open pgAdmin from the Start menu. This will add an icon to the system tray. 
   Right-click the pgAdmin icon and select **New pgAdmin windowâ€¦**, which will open 
   in your browser. Sign in with your Postgres admin user credentials that you selected during
   Postgres installation.
1. **Create User**: From the tree-view on the left, find **Login/Group Roles**. Right-click it and select
   **Createâ†’Login/Group Roleâ€¦**. Name the user `opencue` and choose a secure password, then hit **Save**.
1. **Create Database**: From the tree-view on the left, find **Databases**. Right-click it and
   select **Createâ†’Databaseâ€¦**. Name the database `opencue`, then hit **Save**.
1. **Populate Database**: Next you will need to populate the database. Following the instructions on the
   [Setting up the Database](/docs/getting-started/setting-up-the-database/) 
   page to populate the database, you can:
   1. Download the latest `schema-*.sql` from [the releases page](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/releases).
   1. In pgAdmin right-click the `opencue` database, and select **Query Toolâ€¦**.
   1. In the Query Editor click the **ðŸ“‚ Open File** icon and open the `.sql` file you downloaded.
   1. Click the **â–¶ Execute** icon to populate the database.
1. **Insert Demo Data**: You will also need the demo data to run the full environment locally.
   Download the latest `demo_data-*.sql` from the releases page and run it against the `opencue` database as in the previous step.
1. **Grant Permissions**: In pgAdmin, right click on the `opencue` database and select **Grant Wizard**.
   Use the select-all box to select all items, then select **Next**. Add the `opencue` user and select `ALL` privileges,
   then select **Next** again, and finally **Finish**.

## Configure Cuebot for local database access

Add the database and user credentials into `cuebot/src/main/resources/opencue.properties`, e.g.:

```
datasource.cue-data-source.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
datasource.cue-data-source.jdbc-url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/opencue
datasource.cue-data-source.username=opencue
datasource.cue-data-source.password=xxxxxx
```

## Configure PyCue for local CueBot server

You will need to change the default servers for the `opencue` Python library, so that
it can find your local CueBot server. Open `pycue/opencue/default.yaml`, and edit
the end of the file to look like:

```yaml
cuebot.facility_default: local
cuebot.facility:
  local:
  - localhost:8443
```

## Generate gRPC .proto files

Generating the `.proto` gRPC protocol files for RQD and the PyCue library is currently a manual process.

First, open Powershell and install the required gRPC tools:

```powershell
pip install grpcio-tools
```

Next `cd` to the `proto` folder and run the following commands (from `proto/README.md`):

```powershell
python -m grpc_tools.protoc --proto_path=. --python_out=../rqd/rqd/compiled_proto --grpc_python_out=../rqd/rqd/compiled_proto (ls *.proto).Name
python -m grpc_tools.protoc --proto_path=. --python_out=../pycue/opencue/compiled_proto --grpc_python_out=../pycue/opencue/compiled_proto (ls *.proto).Name
```

The `.proto` files also need some post-processing to make them compatible with Python 3.
The easiest way to do this is to run `2to3`: 

```powershell
pip install 2to3
2to3 -wn (ls ../rqd/rqd/compiled_proto/*_pb2*)
2to3 -wn (ls ../pycue/opencue/compiled_proto/*_pb2*)
```

## Running CueBot

CueBot is the core component of OpenCue, written in Java.

To build and run it with IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and choose **Open**, select the `cuebot` folder in the git repository.
   The IDE will download and set up Gradle, if needed. This can take some time.
1. Browse to the `src/main/java/com.imageworks/spcue/CuebotApplication` file.
   Right-click the `main` method and choose **Run**. (This will alter the default Run 
   configuration so that you can use Shift+F10 to run it afterwards.)
1. Ensure that the output window doesnâ€™t show any errors. If it does, double-check that you
   have set up the database correctly, including permissions, and have placed the connection
   settings into `main/resources/opencue.properties` (see above).

## Running CueSubmit

CueSubmit lets you submit jobs to OpenCue, it is written in Python.

To get setup and run it with PyCharm:

1. Open PyCharm and choose **Open**, select the `cuesubmit` folder in the git repository.
1. For the project interpreter, you can either set up a Venv (usually recommended if
   you are working on other Python projects), or leave it as the default Python interpreter.
1. PyCharm should prompt you to install â€˜Package requirementsâ€™. If not, open the `setup.py`
   and the banner should appear. Select **Install Requirements** and wait for the packages
   to be installed. (PySide2 can take some time to install.)
1. You will need to add additional content roots to find the `opencue` and `outline` libraries.
   Under **Fileâ†’Settings** find **Project: cuesubmit/Project Structure**; click the âž• next
   to **Add Content Root** and add the `pycue` folder. Do the same with the `pyoutline` folder.
   Select **OK** to exit.
1. Right click on `cuesubmit/ui/__main__.py` and select **Run**.

## Running CueGUI

CueGUI lets you monitor the status of jobs and rendering hosts. It is written in Python.

To get setup and run it with PyCharm:

1. Open PyCharm and choose **Open**, select the `cuegui` folder in the git repository.
1. For the project interpreter, you can either set up a Venv (usually recommended if
   you are working on other Python projects), or leave it as the default Python interpreter.
1. PyCharm should prompt you to install â€˜Package requirementsâ€™. If not, open the `setup.py`
   and the banner should appear. Select **Install Requirements** and wait for the packages
   to be installed. (PySide2 can take some time to install.)
1. You will need to add additional content roots to find the `opencue` library.
   Under **Fileâ†’Settings** find **Project: cuegui/Project Structure**; click the âž• next
   to **Add Content Root** and add the `pycue` folder.
   Select **OK** to exit.
1. Right click on `cuegui/__main__.py` and select **Run**.

## Running RQD

RQD is the OpenCue rendering host agent. It is written in Python.

To get set up and run it with PyCharm:

1. Open PyCharm and choose **Open**, select the `rqd` folder in the git repository.
1. For the project interpreter, you can either set up a Venv (usually recommended if
   you are working on other Python projects), or leave it as the default Python interpreter.
1. PyCharm should prompt you to install â€˜Package requirementsâ€™. If not, open the `setup.py`
   and the banner should appear. Select **Install Requirements** and wait for the packages
   to be installed. 
1. Right click on `rqd/__main__.py` and select **Run**.

## Verify end-to-end

Once you are running CueBot, CueGUI, and RQD simultaneously, you should be able to see
the RQD host in CueGUI (in the **Monitor Hosts** section, check the **Auto-refresh** box):

![A screenshot of CueGUI showing host](/docs/images/windows/verify_host.png)

Next, you can check that you can run a job by running CueSubmit. Fill out Job, Shot,
and Layer Name as you like, and set the Command to `ping opencue.io`. Set Frame Spec to
`1`, then hit **Submit**:
